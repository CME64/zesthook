Limesurvey Plugin that allows you to send a post request on each survey completion

This plugin is designed to work with [Evently Zest](https://zest.evently.nl), but can easily be adapted to suit your own needs.
See this [story](https://medium.com/@evently/creating-limesurvey-plugins-adcdf8d7e334#.ixjy5h1o1) on Medium on how it works, and how to adapt it. 

PR's are welcome!
